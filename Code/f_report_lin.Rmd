# Methods

## Data Cleaning & Transformation
Data of 40 subjects was provided, containing information of relative abundances of 8 bacterial species (to be divided in 2 geni) present in their armpit, their BMI, age and gender. 1 observation was removed due to missing data. The categorical variable 'Gender' needed some cleaning to remove whitespaces around some codings of gendertype. For readability and easier coding the names 'Corynebacterium1' etc.. was shortened to 'Cb1' as was 'Staphylococcus1' etc.. shortened to 'St1'
A string variable 'top3' was created, refering to the top 3 classes per individual.
This gives us a 26 categories for 39 individuals...We also create top1 and top2, further aggregating the dominant bacteria and lessening the possible combinations.


### Descriptive analysis
When we view the data of age and CBorST, and sort on CBorST, we see no one above 30 has CB as dominant group. First indication of change in composition. When plotting the Geni with age, we see Corynebacterium having a cluster of low values in the younger age group, and Staphylococcus having a cluster of high values in the younger age group. 

### Categorical variable
Moreover, the continous variable Age is discreted to Agecat as a categorical variable The Agecat is a 3 level ordered factor variable made up by Junior(<=26), Adult(27<=age<=50), Senior(>=51), which is prepared for analysis the relationship of agecat and genus composition.

## Categorical variable analysis
### Interaction among factors
We should confirm that there is no interaction among those factors(Agecat, Gender, BMI) before we do the ANOVA for each of them. We used the two-way ANOVA and interaction graphs to check if the intercations are statistically significant. If the the interactions between Agecat and other two factors are statistically significant, the Agecat variable cannot be analyzed. In this situation, we have to take consider of the interaction of both factors rather than the individual factor. If there are no interaction between each two of them, then we can do the one-way ANOVA to Agecat.

### One-way ANOVA
The sample sizes of each Agecat are unequal, the normally one-way ANOVA and POST HOC test, such as Fisher's LSD and Tukey's HSD, are not availiable for this situation. So we choosed the Kruskalâ€“Wallis test with the null hypothesis that the medians of all groups are equal, and the alternative hypothesis that at least one population median of one group is different from the population median of at least one other group.

## Choice of non parametric tests
We are confronted with asample size and since no information is given about the underlying distribution, we have to rely on non-parametric methods to make valid inferences.
For correlation testing, we consulted Hauke & Kowoski(2011)'s comparison of correlation tests, and concluded that Spearman rank was suitable for our problem.

To better understand the Spearman Rank correlation significance test, we simulated
data with the same sample size (n1=n2=13) which resembles what we observed and with higher sample sizes.. We noted that smaller sample sizes take higher correlation estimates for a significant p-value.
Here we will sample from the uniform distribution and multiply by 100 (reflects our data)
For Type1 testing, we sample from the exact distribution
For Power testing, we limit the var1 range between .40 & .55, and create var2 by substracting var1 from 100 so they sum to 100 (as in our aggregated CB & ST).

We also checked the Type1 error in a simulation, and saw it being controlled for Spearman Rank cor test, similar to more established tests. 

For group comparisons the anova was out of order, but the Wilcoxon Rank test as seen in the course was suitable.


# Results

## Agecat analysis
### Interaction analysis

The interaction graphs both show the across of the lines, which means there are interactions between Agecat and Gender/BMI. From the ANOVA tables, we found the p-value of Agecat:Gender and Agecat:BMI are 0.3689 and 0.2056 perspectively. As the interactions are not statistically significant, we are allowed to use one-way ANOVA to analysis the Agecat varible individully.

```

### Kruskal-Wallis test of Agecat

The boxplot shows that there are some difference between 3 agecats. From the result of the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, we found the p-value is 0.09773, which is greater than alpha(0.05), so we cannot reject the null hypothesis with this test.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#Kruskal Wallis test
boxplot(ST~Agecat,
        ylab = "Staphylococcus",
        main = "Staphylococcus by Agecat")
kruskal.test(ST~Agecat)
```
## Age as continuous variable

To verify if genus composition changes with age we use smooth line plot for each species in the two genus groups. However it is noticed that availability of relative abundances of all four species are not equal. For instance,  from Corynebacteria, Corynebacterium.2 is most dominant species, followed by Corynebacterium.1 (see appendix... for detail plots). In the Corynebacterium.1, the relative abundancy keeps constant value of 0% at young ages and suddenly increases  at around 30 year. It reaches maximum (approximately 41%)in age between 40 and 60 years, where after 60 year it gradually drops to 0%. 

In Staphylococcus genus the dominant species is staphylococcus.1 (appendixx..). In opposite to Corynebacteria at young age it attains higher relative abundance (greater than 75%), which gradually decreases till age of 40 year. The relative abundance remains constant at its minimum (below 50 ) between age of 40 and 60 years, and increases for ages older than 60 year.

```

For ease of interpretation and  comparison between  two Genus groups, we aggregate each of the four species in to one respective  group,  Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus. The result shows that the distribution of aggregated genus groups follows the dominant species distribution. As a result for Corynebacterium the relative abundancy gets minimum at the early age of around 20, and suddenly increases at around 24 year. It gets maximum approximately at age 43 and 60 years.  It drops gradually for ages older than 60 year. 

In case of Staphylococcus the relative abundancy is high at early age of about 20 and gradually deacreses with increasing age.  Lower relative abundacy for this genus is attined when age is between 40 and 60.  For older ages than 60 its availability decreases so as its amount.

It is clearly seen that the change in relative abundancy with age is not linear. consquently the correlations between the aggregated relative abundancy and age is calculated using the spearman correlation test in R.  correlation coefficient obtained for Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus is 0.40 and -0.41.

# Conclusion

## Genus composition relate to age

### Genus composition among agecat
Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we cannot to reject the null hypothesis, which means the genus composition do not shows significant difference among Agecat.
